            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Josh Toloza‚Äîa third-year Computer Science student and former educator turned developer, passionate about designing technology that solves real-world problems. My background in teaching honed my ability to break down complex systems, communicate clearly with diverse stakeholders, and deliver solutions that truly serve end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I apply that same skill set to technology‚Äîbuilding smart, scalable systems that streamline operations, automate workflows, and make data accessible and actionable. From leading international security software rollouts to creating custom web tools that cut processing times from minutes to seconds, I thrive at the intersection of problem-solving, integration, and user-focused design.
            </p>    
            <p>
                I'm seeking opportunities to grow as a full stack developer, leveraging my unique blend of education, IT operations, and software development expertise to build tools that make a tangible impact.
            </p>
